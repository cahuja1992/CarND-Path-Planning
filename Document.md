# Model Documentation

The model comprises of majorly four parts:

* ## Analyze Sensor Fusion Data
* ## Calculate target speed and the lane
* ## Find the jerk minimizing tracjectories and fit splines to the waypoints

In order to accomplish all the above mentioned tasks, following things has been accomodated int eh model:

1. #### Find the closest car in the front lane and estimate the velocity, similarily find the car in rear and front cars in left and right lanes. In order to aachieve this, the following information provided is being used. car_id, car_x, car_y, car_vx, car_vy, car_s and car_d
By grouping the coordinates of every car and then calculating the distance.
      
2. #### Given in the dataset is the `car_d` value which is used to decide the target speed for the lane

   Lane 1 : car_d = 2
   Lane 2 : car_d = 6
   Lane 3 : car_d = 10
   
   `car_s` is used to control the speed as follow: 
   Max speed, s increment = 0.415.
   Brake in the current lane, s increment to be retarded based on the speed of the front car.
   
3. #### Tracjectory planning
   -  Minimize acceleration and Jerk when the car first starts
   pos_s += min(target_s, (delta_prev_s*(1.005)+0.002))
   - smooth acceleration and braking
   double s_smoothing_steps = 80;
   double delta_s = (target_s_inc â€“ prev_s_inc)/s_smoothing_steps;

   - Smooth change of lanes
   double d_smoothing_steps = 80;
   double delta_d = (target_d - prev_d) / d_smoothing_steps;
   pos_d += min(delta_d, 0.02);
   target_s += min(delta_s, 0.01);
   
   Then spline is fit on x, y, dx and dy based on pos_s which estimates pos_x, pos_y
4. Frenet coordinates are being used in order to plan the whole path. Instead of using the given getXY function spline.h is used which creates splines and also provides derivatives of first and second orders.
